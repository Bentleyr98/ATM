# Development Environment
I used IntelliJ as my IDE and created a database in mySQL. I also used Git and GitHub to make in open source.

IntelliJ
Git & GitHub
MySQL 8.0

For this program, I used Java as my main language and little bit from SQL to run the queries. Because I was using
SQL, this alway required that I imported java sql to help with exceptions, run statements, etc. I also used java util
to read data in from the user.

Java version 17.0.3
SQL

Libraries
* java sql
* java util Scanner

# Future Work
I've done a lot on this project and taught myself Java in the process, however there are still some changes I would
like to update/improve on in the future.

* Figure out a more efficient way of connecting to the database.

* Write their receipts to a text file on their computer.

* Get it to always show two decimal places.
